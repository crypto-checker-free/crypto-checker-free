‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  WalletGen is made for research and educational purposes. It should not be used for illegal or unauthorized activities. Always use it responsibly and only on wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen implements the standard [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) protocols for Bitcoin wallet generation, while employing [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum.

The core functionality involves comparing generated addresses against pre-existing databases, in addition to checking wallet balances in real-time via blockchain explorers. WalletGen, built with C++, offers significantly higher wallet generation speeds. Performance is largely influenced by your CPU and GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Free Crypto Checking?

Need a free and speedy method to check your crypto balances?  **WalletGen** is your perfect choice. Unlike Python-based alternatives, it's engineered in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage. This delivers up to **10x faster** performance. If you want to instantly verify balances, or explore the contents of your wallet, WalletGen offers an efficient, secure, and free solution.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** helps to check wallet balances via brute-force methods.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press `3` or run `start_search_btc.bat` for an online search. May take longer due to real-time checks.
*   Press `6` for database search. This is faster.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for online searches.
*   Press `6` for a faster database search.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your GPU significantly impacts speed. Use multiple instances (1 to 4).

Databases make the process faster.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

If WalletGen finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will **Stop** immediately.
*   The details are **Displayed** in the console.
*   The data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into a crypto wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  Transfer the funds.

>  Consider donating if a wallet is found.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can help recover your Bitcoin wallet using the seed phrase. Enter it in full or use wildcards.

### Process Description

#### Search for Missing Words:

Use * for missing words. WalletGen checks all combinations.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed. WalletGen generates and checks addresses.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrases have 12 words.
*   Use * only for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words takes time.
*   Upon recovery, data is saved.
